How many stickers does Sally have now?\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Find how many stickers Sally gave away in total by adding 45 and 30, which equals 75 stickers.\nStep 2: Subtract the 75 stickers that Sally gave away from the original 250 stickers she had, which equals 175 stickers.\nStep 3: Add the 20 new stickers she bought to the 175 stickers she had left, which equals 195 stickers.\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is about addition and subtraction. First, we add the stickers that Sally gave to her brother and her friend to find the total number of stickers she gave away. Then, we subtract this total from the amount of stickers she originally had to find out how many she had left. Finally, we add the new stickers she bought to the number of stickers she had left to find out how many stickers she now has.\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nA library has 5 shelves and each shelf can hold 28 books. How many books can the library hold in total?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the total number of books the library can hold, multiply the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold.

If the teacher divided the class into groups of 4 for a project, how many groups would there be?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the number of groups, divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group. So, 24 students divided by 4 students per group equals 6 groups.\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is about division. We are given that there are 24 students and each group should have 4 students. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of students (24) by the number of students in each group (4). This gives us the number of groups the teacher can make."}
