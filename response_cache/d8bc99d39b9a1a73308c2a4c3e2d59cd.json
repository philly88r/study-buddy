This gives 2x = 13 - 5, or 2x = 8.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x. This gives x = 8 / 2 or x = 4.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first step, we need to isolate the term with the variable (2x) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides, which gives us 2x = 8. In the second step, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x, which gives us x = 4.\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nSolve for y: 3y - 7 = 2\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Add 7 to both sides of the equation. This gives 3y = 2 + 7, or 3y = 9.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for y. This gives y = 9 / 3 or y = 3.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first step, we need to isolate the term with the variable (3y) on one side of the equation. We do this by adding 7 to both sides, which gives us 3y = 9. In the second step, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for y, which gives us y = 3.\n\n---\n\nProblem 3:\nSolve for z: 4z + 2 = 18\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. This gives 4z = 18 - 2, or 4z = 16.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for z. This gives z = 16 / 4 or z = 4.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first step, we need to isolate the term with the variable (4z) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 2 from both sides, which gives us 4z = 16. In the second step, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for z, which gives us z = 4."}
