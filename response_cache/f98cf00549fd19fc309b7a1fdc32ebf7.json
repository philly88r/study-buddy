However, I can provide a solution and explanation for the given quadratic equation.\n\n---\n\nProblem 1: \nSolve the quadratic equation x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0 using the quadratic formula.\n\nSolution: \n\nStep 1: Identify the values of a, b, and c in the quadratic equation. In this case, a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6.\n\nStep 2: Substitute these values into the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nStep 3: Substitute a, b, and c into the formula: x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt((5)\u00b2 - 4*1*6)] / 2*1\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation: x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 24)] / 2\n\nStep 5: Further simplify: x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(1)] / 2\n\nStep 6: Solve for x: x = [-5 \u00b1 1] / 2\n\nThe solutions are x = -2 and x = -3.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe quadratic formula is a universal method for solving quadratic equations. It is derived from the method of completing the square. The formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a. Here, 'a' is the coefficient of x\u00b2, 'b' is the coefficient of x, and 'c' is the constant term. The \u00b1 sign indicates that there are usually two solutions for x in a quadratic equation, unless the term under the square root (b\u00b2 - 4ac), known as the discriminant, is zero. In this case, the discriminant was 1, which is why there are two solutions: x = -2 and x = -3."}
