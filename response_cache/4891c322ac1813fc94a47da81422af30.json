We start by getting rid of the number that is being subtracted from the x term. To do this, we add 7 to both sides, resulting in 3x = 21. Then, to isolate x, we divide each side by 3, which gives us x = 7.\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nSolve for y: 2y + 5 = 9\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 2y = 4\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 2: y = 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe goal here is to isolate y. We start by subtracting 5 from both sides to get rid of the added number on the y term, which gives us 2y = 4. Then, to fully isolate y, we divide each side by 2, resulting in y = 2.\n\n---\n\nProblem 3:\nSolve for z: 6z / 3 = 2\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Multiply both sides by 3: 6z = 6\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 6: z = 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe goal here is to isolate the variable z. We start by getting rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by 3, which gives us 6z = 6. Then, we isolate z by dividing each side by 6, resulting in z = 1."}
