This gives us 3x = 12.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 4.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this problem, we are trying to find the value of x that makes the equation true. First, we isolate the term with x on one side of the equation by subtracting 4 from both sides. Then we divide by 3 to find the value of x. The solution x = 4 means that if we substitute 4 for x in the original equation, both sides will be equal.\n\n---\n\nProblem 2:\nSolve the equation for x: 2x - 5 = 9\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Add 5 to both sides of the equation. This gives us 2x = 14.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us x = 7.\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve for x, we first need to isolate the term with x. We do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation, to get rid of the -5 on the left side. Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x. The solution x = 7 means that if we substitute 7 for x in the original equation, both sides will be equal.\n\n---\n\nProblem 3:\nSolve the equation for x: 4x + 2 = 18\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. This gives us 4x = 16.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 4. This gives us x = 4.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this problem, we are trying to find the value of x that makes the equation true. To do this, we first isolate the term with x by subtracting 2 from both sides. Then we divide by 4 to find the value of x.
